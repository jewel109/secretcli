# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the Secret CLI project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment where individuals feel safe and respected.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Using inclusive and respectful language
- Showing empathy and kindness towards others
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Helping to mentor or guide new contributors
- Encouraging collaboration over conflict

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate or unethical in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include the use of an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event. The same standards apply to behavior in these areas as they do within project-specific contexts.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [mokhlesur.mahin@gmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.


Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
